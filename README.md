## Introduction: 
Our study intends to determine the high rate of depression and anxiety among college students, given their notable negative impact on social interactions and academic performance. Physical and mental exhaustion are common signs of anxiety and depression, but these symptoms are usually minor and may go unrecognized, leaving sufferers unaware of their increasing control over their thoughts and feelings. This misinformation raises the possibility of unintentionally delaying crucial therapy, which raises the risk of engaging in risky behaviors like substance abuse.

Students who struggle with depression and anxiety have psychological difficulties related to their academic work, their studies, and their interactions with peers and professors. Both social conduct and academic performance may suffer as a result of these difficulties. 

## Goals: 
To address these issues, our project aims to explore trends, patterns, and factors to predict the likelihood and severity of depression among university students. Our dataset includes information on school year, depressiveness, anxiousness, and sleepiness, offering valuable insights. Students who struggle with depression and anxiety have psychological difficulties related to their academic work, their studies, and their interactions with peers and professors. Both social conduct and academic performance may suffer as a result of these difficulties.

## Summary

### Initial Actions:
1. Describe the task of data mining.
2. Examine and read the dataset.                   
3. Preserve the original dataset
4. Explain the properties and dataset.
5. Display a dataset sample.

### Missing values:
The codes in this section are designed to help you find the missing values in the dataset. Our analysis shows that several attributes in our dataset do, in fact, contain missing values or NULLS.

### Central tendency measures:

### Graph visualization:

### Concept hierarchy generation for nominal data:

### Encoding categorical data  
We encoded categorical values, including those within columns with character types, and simultaneously removed irrelevant attributes like student id. This approach aligns with the optimization of machine learning algorithms, as they are typically designed to operate more efficiently with factors data rather than character data. Additionally, this encoding enhances the overall performance and interpretability of the data.

### Feature selection and dimensionality reduction:

### Finding and removing outliers:

### Discretization: 

### Normalization:

## Clustering:
##### Main points:
- K-means algorithm-based unsupervised learning techniques were utilized.
- The "depressiveness" attribute was left out of the clustering analysis.
- A variety of data types were taken into consideration including:
    - Age
    - Gender
    - BMI
    - WHO BMI
    - PHQ score
    - depression severity
    - diagnosis and treatment of depression
    - GAD score
    - Anxiety severity
    - Anxiousness
    - diagnosis and treatment of anxiety
    - Empworth score
    - sleepiness.
- Categorical values were encoded, and unnecessary characteristics like student IDs were deleted.
