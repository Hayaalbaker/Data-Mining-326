Depression and anxiety, both mentally and physically draining, are prevalent mental illnesses. While some signs and symptoms may be apparent, others may go unnoticed. In fact, depressive symptoms can manifest in various ways, leading individuals to be unaware that their thoughts and feelings are increasingly dominated by depression. This lack of awareness may inadvertently delay receiving necessary treatment, increasing the risk of engaging in risky behaviors such as substance abuse. Additionally, depression can strain relationships, impede recovery from serious illnesses, and create difficulties in the workplace. Therefore, early identification of depression is crucial to intervene promptly and minimize its impact.

Students experiencing depression and anxiety often struggle with academic tasks, studying, and interpersonal relationships with peers and teachers. These psychological challenges have a detrimental effect on both academic performance and social behavior. Thus, our project aims to explore trends, patterns, and factors to predict the likelihood and severity of depression among university students.  Our class label will be the probability that indicates whether university student is likely to develop depression or not.
