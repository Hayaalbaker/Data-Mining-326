## Introduction: 
Our study intends to determine the high rate of depression and anxiety among college students, given their notable negative impact on social interactions and academic performance. Physical and mental exhaustion are common signs of anxiety and depression, but these symptoms are usually minor and may go unrecognized, leaving sufferers unaware of their increasing control over their thoughts and feelings. This misinformation raises the possibility of unintentionally delaying crucial therapy, which raises the risk of engaging in risky behaviors like substance abuse.

Students who struggle with depression and anxiety have psychological difficulties related to their academic work, their studies, and their interactions with peers and professors. Both social conduct and academic performance may suffer as a result of these difficulties. 

## Goals: 
To address these issues, our project aims to explore trends, patterns, and factors to predict the likelihood and severity of depression among university students. Our dataset includes information on school year, depressiveness, anxiousness, and sleepiness, offering valuable insights. Students who struggle with depression and anxiety have psychological difficulties related to their academic work, their studies, and their interactions with peers and professors. Both social conduct and academic performance may suffer as a result of these difficulties.
